Player is a class, and player1, player2 are objects of that class.

private: hides data from direct access.

public: allows interaction through functions (methods).

Constructors help initialize object values.

/*
Sometimes it is better to declare the method in the class and define it later (especially in large programs).

class MyClass {        // The class
  public:              // Access specifier
    void myMethod();   // Method/function declaration
};

// Method/function definition outside the class
void MyClass::myMethod() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
}

/*
Constructors are special class members which are called by the compiler every time an object of that class is instantiated.
They are used to construct the objects and making them ready for use.
Constructors have the same name as the class.
