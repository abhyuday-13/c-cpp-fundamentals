/*
A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend.
Friendship is not inherited.

Friendship is not mutual (if A is a friend of B, B isnâ€™t automatically a friend of A).

Friendship is not transitive (if A is friend of B, and B is friend of C, A is not friend of C).
